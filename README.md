# LinkedList, Now You Know

The generated sound files attached are both the score only and the score with lyrics of the newest educational Data Structures song, "LinkedList, Now You Know." I composed the song to follow a dembow-type beat that would create swing and movement throughout the piece. My hope is that this catchy, upbeat drum line will keep the listener engaged throughout. To reinforce this rhythm as the foundation of the song, I mirrored the bass line on top. This creates a round, full, and cohesive sound. To add in variety and cement the overall beat of the song, I interspersed hi-hats both on and off beat.

I implemented both an intro and outro, which depart from the verse, chorus, and brige. This way, the listener would have signals of both the end and beginning of the tune. I followed the traditional structure of ABABCB (A = verse, B = chorus, C = bridge) in order to maintain a catchy, predictable, and familiar formula. I believe that these characteristics are important considerations, particularly for an educational and fun piece. For the verses, I researched chrod progressions that fit nicely with a dembow beat and landed on → A minor, F major, C major,  G major. These chords felt natural to me and when laid over the bass and drums, gave a melodic dimnension that I thought was compatible. To keep the verses connected but unique, I altered the chord progression for the second verse → G major, A minor, F major, C major.

When approaching the bridge, I wanted this to be a departure from the other parts of the song and almost like a build-up to the last chorus. To achieve this, I included guitar samples, which add an eerie feel to the uniform beat. Finally, when crafting the chorus, I decided to go simple. I think that this simplicity will allow the listener to really hear the chorus lyrics and will boost the song's "catchiness." Therefore, the chorus is built of bass hits on beat that add emphasis and do not overwhelm the listener.

When crafting lyrics to explain the concept of LinkedLists, I wanted to offer an overall introduction to the concept, while also giving the listener some valuable knowledge concerning implementation. To do so, I devoted the second verse to describing the logic of adding to the LinkedList, and the bridge to the logic of the removal to the LinkedList.
