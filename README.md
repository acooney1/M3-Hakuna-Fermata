# LinkedList, Now You Know

This repository contains generated sound files that are the score only and the score with lyrics of the newest educational Data Structures song, "LinkedList, Now You Know." I composed the song to follow a dembow-type beat that would create swing and movement throughout the piece. My hope is that this catchy, upbeat drum line will keep the listener engaged throughout. To reinforce this rhythm as the foundation of the song, I mirrored the bass line on top. This creates a round, full, and cohesive sound. To add in variety and cement the overall beat of the song, I interspersed hi-hats both on and off of the beat.

I implemented both an intro and outro, which depart from the verse, chorus, and bridge. This way, the listener has signals of both the end and beginning of the tune. I followed the traditional structure of ABABCB (A = verse, B = chorus, C = bridge) in order to maintain a catchy, predictable, and familiar formula. I believe that these characteristics are important considerations, particularly for an educational and fun song. For the verses, I researched chord progressions that fit nicely with a dembow beat and landed on → A minor, F major, C major, G major. These chords felt natural to me and when laid over the bass and drums, gave a melodic dimension that I thought was compatible. To keep the verses connected but unique, I altered the chord progression for the second verse → G major, A minor, F major, C major.

When approaching the bridge, I wanted this to be a departure from the other parts of the song and almost like a build-up to the last chorus. To achieve this, I included guitar samples, which add an eerie, somber feel to the uniform beat. This emotional aspect is connected to the semtiment of the removal of a node. Finally, when crafting the chorus, I decided to go simple. I think that this simplicity will allow the listener to really hear the chorus lyrics and will boost the song's "catchiness." Therefore, the chorus is built of bass hits on beat that add emphasis and do not overwhelm the listener.

When crafting lyrics to explain the concept of LinkedLists, I wanted to offer an overall introduction to the concept, while also giving the listener some valuable knowledge concerning implementation to move forward with. To do so, I devoted the first verse to introducing the necessary terms of the topic, the second verse to describing the logic of adding to the LinkedList, and the bridge to the logic of removal from the LinkedList. For both, I attempted to keep my language simple, but to also hint at the more complex capability to traverse a LinkedList using a Node class. The idea of pointers and data can be confusing at first, so I wanted to show that in my video with moving parts. My wonderful roommates helped me bring my vision of a human LinkedList to life, and perfectly acted out the addition of a new head and the removal of the previous head as part of the second verse and the bridge.
